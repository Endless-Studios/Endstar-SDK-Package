# What's this about?
The Endstar SDK allows you to use Unity to create custom props and terrain for use in [Endstar](https://endlessstudios.com/games/Endstar).

After creating the terrain or props you can export them to the cloud and then use them in Endstar. You can even share them with others.

## Getting Started
Unity 2022.3.28f1 is required, and you need to install the following modules: Android Build Support, iOS Build Support, Linux Build Support (Mono), Mac Build Support (Mono) and Windows Build Support (IL2PCC).
Check out the [Endstar SDK](https://endstar.wiki.gg/wiki/Endstar_SDK) wiki page for full details on the installation process.

After exporting a prop to Endstar, you can use the in game tools to write custom Lua code to create new behaviors!
